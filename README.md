# Recommender_System

This project aims to take user data obtained through a questionaire and utilize neural networks in order to recommend a headset that best fits their use case based on headphone parameters. 

It may in some form utilize different forms of Regression, Deep Artificial Neural Networks, Auto Encoders for dimensionality reduction, Generative Adversarial Networks for data augmentation, and Statistical methods for data augmentation.

It will remain a work in progress. Long term goals include adding more common methods of recomender systems such as user-based and item-based collaborative filtering as more real data is obtained. 

Current issues remain in obtaining real data so we will explore artificial creation of data, data augmentation, and bootstrapping while collecting real data.

# 1. Problem Definition

How useful a recommendation can we get?

# 2. Data

The data is obtained from various online sources but is for the most part in this stage synthetic data created just to test useability of the code. 

# 3. Evaluation

TBD We will utilize a custom loss function and have yet to decide on our metrics for accuracy.

# 4. Features

TBD Currently used features available in the datasets in the data_in_use folders.  

# Files

After cleaning up the useless ones we will provide a definition of those remaining. This remains a work in progress.
